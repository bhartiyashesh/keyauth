## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Setup: TLS-only relay (no E2E encryption) — simplicity, user owns the relay, codes expire in 30s
- Setup: WebSocket relay over Bluetooth — Chrome extensions cannot use Web Bluetooth API
- Setup: Click-to-request flow — user initiates from extension, not auto-detect-push
- Setup: Railway for relay hosting — user's explicit preference, Vercel excluded
- Setup: APNs alert push (not silent) — silent push throttled at ~3/hour by Apple

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- APNs p8 key and Team ID required before Phase 1 relay can send pushes — obtain from Apple Developer portal before starting Phase 2 work
- Railway project must be created and CLI configured before Phase 1 deploy step
